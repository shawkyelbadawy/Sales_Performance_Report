# Retail Sales Performance Analysis📊

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves an analysis of a **Retail Sales Dataset** to uncover key insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends. Using Power BI, I transformed raw data into an interactive dashboard that helps stakeholders to make data-driven decisions regarding inventory and marketing.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies 
- **Power BI:** Data visualization and dashboard construction.
- **Power Query:** Data cleaning, data formating and type conversion.
- **DAX:** Created **Age Bins** (18-24, 25-35, 36-50, 50+) to segment customer demographics.
  - Calculated **Total Revenue** and **Average Ticket Size** measures.

## 🚀 Key Features & Insights 
The dashboard provides a high-level summary of **$456K in Total Revenue** across 1,000 transactions. Key insights include:
- **Sales Trends:** Identified a significant revenue peak in **May**, followed by a steady recovery in **Q4**.
- **Product Performance: Electronics** is the leading category with **$157K**, closely followed by **Clothing $156K**, indicating a balanced product mix.
- **Demographic Targeting:** The **36-50 age group** represents the heighst spending demographic **($71K for Females, $69K for Males)**.
- **Basket Analysis:** Sales are evenly distributed across quantities (1 to 4 units), suggesting the customers frequently engage in multi-item purchases.

## 📁 Dataset Description
The dataset contains:
- **Transaction ID:** Unique identifier for each sale.
- **Date:** Transaction timestamp (cleaned and formatted).
- **Customer Details:** Gender and Age.
- **Product Category:** Electronics, Clothing, and Beauty.
- **Financials:** Quantity, Price per Unit, and Total Amount.

## 📈 Visualization Included
- **KPI Cards:** Total Transactions, Units Sold, Revenue, and Average Ticket Size.
- **Total Revenue by Month:** Time-series line chart with **drill-down hierarchy** (Quarter >Year > Month > Day).
- **Revenue by Category:** Bar chart identifying top-performing departments with a **custom tooltip**.
- **Age & Gender Analysis:** Clustered column chart showing spending power by demographic.
- **Quantity Distribution:** Donut chart illustrating common basket sizes.

## 💡 Recommendations
Based on the data, I recommend:
- **Targeted Marketing:** Focus high-ticket electronic promotions on the 25-50 age bracket, as they show the highest conversion rates.
- **Inventory Planning:** Increase stock levels in April to prepare for the May sales surge.
- **Bundling Strategy:** Since 4-unit purchases are common **(26.3%)**, implement **"Buy 3, Get 1 Free"** bundles to further increase the Average Ticket Size.
